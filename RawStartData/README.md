# Raw Input Data
- this is data provided before any work has been done
    - it is olely for the purpose of analysis

## The Goal
- improve customer retention and analytics
    - see what we can do with etsy data
    - see if we can create a proprietary customer scoring system to tailor outreach (micromarketing)

## Data Sets
### visits.csv (shopify OR google analytics)
- can see which locations are the most popular
- can see which social media is the best
- NOTE: many of these insights can be granted via google's analytics engine, so I can't build much better

### ads.csv (mailchimp report)
- this appears blank

### campaigns.csv (mailchimp report)
- can see which days are best for campaigns
    - this is a direct input for creating tailored mailchimp campaigns
    - can build a an online portal to do this OR can do on a one-off basis
- can see which localities are best for campaigns
    - use zip codes to target demographics
    - can export maps showing sales hotspots

### EtsySoldOrders2020-12.csv
- can see full customer data
- can build engine for finding the best localities to campaign in
- there are no emails, so can't create a list to email
    - have shipping addressm bt not email

## Conclusion
### Big Picture
- I can build analytics tools that can help identify locations (from etsy) and times of the week for ad targeting (from mailchimp)
- there are no emails, so we can't target them directly unless you have more data
- I didn't see the items in the etsy orders, so we can't filter for specific contents

### Software/Services
- portal is more expensive to build, but cheap on a recurring basis ($5-$20 a month just for server costs)
    - only build portal functionality for things that you want done 4+ times a year
    - use for etsy data
    - use for past campaigns
- can do data analysis on a one-off basis
    - just call me, send me the data, and I'll give you insights regarding what to do & how to target clientele
